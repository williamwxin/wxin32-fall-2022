The primary packages to install are seaborn, hiive.mdptoolbox, and matplotlib

Note: The code is not plug and play. Running any of the files directly will lead to errors. MDPfix2.py and conversion.py are not imported into the other files, but their components are required to be ran first. I ran all code in Pycharm, so environment variables would save between scripts.

Besides that, each script is named after which section they generate graphs for. Note that not all lines of code will work, as this was a large trial/error process. Again, I ran code line-by-line in Pycharm without accounting for the runnability of the code as a holistic block.
